I wanted to start my Twitter anew, but saw that all platforms which offer to delete your tweets cost money. Thinking they were being greedy, I thought this could be a fun project to embark on; creating my own deleting platform for free! Turns out, they cost money because X's API is egregiously expensive and the free version is incredibly restrictive; I was only able to do 4 tests an hour and then after a few hours couldn't test anymore cuz all the quotas were hit. But on the final tests, it worked swell!

If you want to run this specifically in spite of the very limited capabilities, email qaziayn@gmail.com with the headline "X program config help!"
